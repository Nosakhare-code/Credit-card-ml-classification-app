# Predicting Credit Card Fraud Transactions Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting **fraudulent credit card transactions** using **machine learning classification techniques**.

Credit card fraud is a major concern for financial institutions. Itâ€™s crucial that banks and card companies can identify fraudulent transactions in real time to prevent financial loss and protect customers.  
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a given transaction is **fraudulent (1)** or **non-fraudulent (0)**.

## Dataset Information

### Context
The dataset contains transactions made by **European cardholders** in **September 2013**.  
It covers **two days of transactions**, totaling **284,807 records**, with **492 fraud cases**.

- **1 = Fraudulent Transaction**  
- **0 = Non-Fraudulent Transaction**

**Imbalance Warning:**  
Fraudulent cases represent only **0.172%** of all transactions â€” this makes the dataset **highly imbalanced**, which is common in fraud detection problems.

**Dataset Source:**

## ðŸ§  Project Goal
The primary goal is to develop a **classification model** capable of detecting fraudulent transactions from historical data.

We aim to achieve:
- High **Recall** â€” correctly identifying most fraudulent transactions  
- Balanced **Precision** â€” minimizing false alarms  
- Good **F1-Score** â€” balancing recall and precision effectively  

---

## Proof of Concept (POC)
The project will be considered successful if it achieves: **Recall â‰¥ 90%**

**Why Recall?**  
In fraud detection, missing a fraud (false negative) is far more costly than a false alarm (false positive).  
A high recall ensures that most fraudulent transactions are caught.

## Key Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Description | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Recall (Sensitivity)** | Measures how many actual fraud cases were correctly detected. | Critical for catching as many frauds as possible. |
| **Precision** | Measures how many of the predicted frauds were actually frauds. | Prevents flagging too many legitimate transactions. |
| **F1-Score** | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. | Balances both metrics for overall performance. |
| **Accuracy** | Percentage of total correct predictions. | Not useful alone in imbalanced data (can be misleading). |
| **AUC-ROC Curve** | Measures modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between classes. | Visual performance comparison across thresholds. |

## Challenges in Real-World Fraud Detection

### Noisy & Imperfect Data
Real-world data contains errors, missing values, and inconsistencies that can reduce model performance.

### Overlapping Class Distributions
Fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions often have similar patterns, making perfect classification impossible.

### Concept Drift
Fraudsters evolve their strategies â€” models must be **retrained regularly** to adapt to new transaction behaviors.

## Steps Taken in the Project

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** â€” Handle missing values and prepare data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€” Analyze transaction trends and imbalance distribution.  
3. **Data Balancing** â€” Use techniques like **SMOTE** or **undersampling** to handle class imbalance.  
4. **Feature Scaling** â€” Normalize continuous features for algorithm compatibility.  
5. **Model Training** â€” Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
6. **Model Evaluation** â€” Assess using Recall, Precision, F1, AUC-ROC.  
7. **Model Comparison & Tuning** â€” Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.  
8. **Deployment Preparation** â€” Save best-performing model and visualize results.
